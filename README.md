# MMEvalPro

We create **MMEvalPro** for more accurate and efficent evaluation for Large Multimodal Models. It is designed to avoid Type-I errors through a **trilogy** evaluation pipeline and more rigorous metrics. For each original question from existing benchmarks, human annotators augment it by creating one **perception** question and one **knowledge** anchor question through a meticulous annotation process. It comprises **2,068** question triplets, totaling **6,204** distinct questions.


## Automatic Evaluation

ðŸ”” To automatically evaluate a model on the dataset and compute the genuine accuracy, average accuracy and different analysis metric, we provide an example code to compute the scores given model output and groundtruth labels.

The output for each instance should be saved in json file, in the format of
```json
[
    {
        "index": 1,
        "model_output": "A",
        "answer": "B",
        "triplet_id": 1,
        "eval_type": "Origin"
    },
    {
        "index": 2,
        "model_output": "A",
        "answer": "B",
        "triplet_id": 1,
        "eval_type": "Perception"
    },
    {
        "index": 3,
        "model_output": "A",
        "answer": "B",
        "triplet_id": 1,
        "eval_type": "Knowledge"
    }
]
```

Then you can run the `./auto_score.py` to get the scores.


```bash
python auto_score.py \ 
    --model_output  ./demo_output.json \  # model output file in json format
    --output_path  ./demo_score.json \  # path to save the result
```
