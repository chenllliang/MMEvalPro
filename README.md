We create **MMEvalPro** for more accurate and efficent evaluation for Large Multimodal Models. It is designed to avoid Type-I errors through a **trilogy** evaluation pipeline and more rigorous metrics. For each original question from existing benchmarks, human annotators augment it by creating one **perception** question and one **knowledge** anchor question through a meticulous annotation process. It comprises **2,068** question triplets, totaling **6,204** distinct questions.

## Trilogy Evaluation

For each original question from ScienceQA, MathVista, or MMMU, MMEvalPro annotates an additional perception question and a knowledge question. Only if a multimodal model can simultaneously answer all three questions, we regard it demonstrates a true understanding of the problem rather than merely exploiting shortcuts. We introduce a new metric called **Genuine Accuracy** to evaluate the performance of models in MMEvalPro.

## Automatic Evaluation

ðŸ”” To automatically evaluate a model on the dataset and compute the genuine accuracy, average accuracy and different analysis metric, we provide an example code to compute the scores given model output and groundtruth labels.

The output for each instance should be saved in json file, in the format of
```json
[
    {
        "index": 1,
        "model_output": "A",
        "answer": "B",
        "triplet_id": 1,
        "eval_type": "Origin"
    },
    {
        "index": 2,
        "model_output": "A",
        "answer": "B",
        "triplet_id": 1,
        "eval_type": "Perception"
    },
    {
        "index": 3,
        "model_output": "A",
        "answer": "B",
        "triplet_id": 1,
        "eval_type": "Knowledge"
    }
]
```
The `index`,`answer`,`triplet_id`,`eval_type` should be indentical to the ones in the dataset.

Then you can run the `./auto_score.py` to get the scores.


```bash
python auto_score.py \ 
    --model_output  ./demo_output.json \  # model output file in json format
    --output_path  ./demo_score.json \  # path to save the result
```

## Leaderboard

All LLMs perform poorly in the benchmark due to the rigorous metric. Best performing LMM (Qwen-VL-Max, GPT4-o) still lag behind human by 30% in average Genuine Accuracy of MMEvalPro.
